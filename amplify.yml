    # No preBuild or build phases are typically needed for simple static HTML sites
    # as there are no dependencies to install or complex compilation steps.

      commands:
        # For a static site, the "build" phase might just be empty, or contain
        # simple commands if you need to move files around.
        # Amplify will automatically pick up files in the baseDirectory.
        - # Placeholder: Add any commands here if you need to process files
          # For a plain index.html in the root, usually no commands are needed.

    files:
      - '**/*' # This tells Amplify to include all files from the baseDirectory
